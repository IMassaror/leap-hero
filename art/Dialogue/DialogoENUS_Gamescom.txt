Merchant: Hello Stranger!

Hero: Uh... Hello... Who are you??

Merchant: He he he, I'm just a humble merchant travelling the world!

Merchant: You seem like a great hero to me...

Hero: Sorry to interrupt you, but I'm currently on an important mission!!

Merchant: Wait! I have something to offer you that I believe will greatly help you on your journey!

Merchant: An amazing FISHING ROD(colorido)!

Hero: Are you serious?...

Merchant: Friend, you have no idea of the benefits of fishing.

Merchant: I know you're in a hurry, but I suggest you relax a bit at the lake right next to us.

Hero: Alright... I guess?

Merchant: Just watch out for the catfish! See you later, friend.

Após a Batalha

Hero: You nearly got me killed!

Merchant: He he he, I apologize, friend. I needed someone to get rid of that monster in my way; it was interfering with my business.

Merchant: I knew you could defeat it.

Hero: I'll never listen to the words of mysterious hooded figures again.

Merchant: Don't worry, friend. You'll be rewarded in the future!

Merchant: Good luck on your journey, we'll meet again...

Frog: It can't be, this is the legendary Excalib-

Excalibro: Exactly, friend, the legendary EXCALIBRO!!

Frog: Y-you can talk?!?

Excalibro: I thank you generously for freeing me from the confinement of the stone! I am eternally grateful for your benevolence and courage.

Excalibro: There was supposed to be a battle with a fierce bear here... but let's skip that part xD

Excalibro: I'll accompany you on your great journey, I guarantee I'll be a great help!

Frog: That's perfect! It's been a while since I lost my sword and armor.

Excalibro: Hold on a moment, friend, I'm not much into combat; I consider myself a pacifist and I also don't like getting dirty!

Frog: ...

Frog: So you're a sword... that doesn't attack?

Excalibro: Exactly :D

Frog: ...

Excalibro: We just met, but unfortunately I have to share some sad news :(

Excalibro: This is the end of this demo, but don't worry! We will have much more soon!
